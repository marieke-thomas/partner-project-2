            <h1>Performing</h1>
            <p>I love performing (which explains why I also enjoy teaching). Here are a few of the performing groups that I've been a part of! </p>
            <img src="Singing.jpg">
            
            <h2>Gotham Rock Choir</h2>
            <p>I'm a current member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gotham-Rock-Choir-154976265558/">Gotham Rock Choir</a>, which is a community choir dedicated to singing Rock, Pop, and Soul music. Here we are performing the songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2PNcR6DGNA">"Price Tag"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2EGuZduY3c">"You Will Be Found"</a>. </p>
        
            <h2>Harvard Noteables</h2>
            <p>In college, I was a member and choreographer for the Harvard Noteables, a non-audition Broadway show choir. Here is me singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqlFCK0A9xM">"One-Feathered Tail"</a> from <i>Seussical</i>, and here's a more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBYEwzK12F8&list=PL08262FB2A5916894&index=5">lyrical duet</a>. One of my favorite songs to choreograph was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw5XihIXHic">"Hynos: Evoe!"</a> from <i>The Frogs</i>.</p>
        
            <h2>Harvard Pops Orchestra</h2>
            <p>I was also a cello player and Creative Board member of the Harvard Pops Orchestra. Here I am playing as an alum in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp40k-QloHg">20th Anniversary Concert!</a></p>
