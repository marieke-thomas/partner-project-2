    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p id="basicinfo"> Hi, I'm Marieke! I'm a high school science teacher (physics and chemistry), as well as an amateur programmer, singer, poet, and cat lover. 
    You can learn more about me by clicking on the links above (to learn about my programming skills, check out any of the links-- I made this website!).
    If you're too lazy to move the mouse and click a link, you can stay here and check out my favorite meme, which combines two of my passions: chemistry and cats.

    <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
    <!--<h3>Are they really fun? I'll let you be the judge.</h3>-->
    <u1>
        <li>I saw Hamilton on Broadway with the original cast! It was totally awesome.</li>
        <li>But my favorite musical is Ragtime.</li>
        <li>I also love penguins.</li>
        <li>I once set my hair on fire while blowing out the candles on my birthday cake.</li>
        <li>In addition to show tunes, I enjoy listening to Billy Joel, Al Stewart, and Taylor Swift (but only the classics, none of this <i>Reputation</i> BS).</li>
        <li>My favorite punctuation mark is the em dash.</li>
        <li>I am a terrible millenial. I hate travel, technology, and avocados, and I am utterly incapable of multitasking.</li>
        <li>My name is Flemish, though I am not. It's pronounced muh-REE-kuh. Well, it's pronounced a lot of ways, but it's <b>correctly</b> pronounced muh-REE-kuh by most people who actually know me (a few coworkers aside).</li>
