    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
    <p>With the advent of Google, Wikipedia, and the internet, it&#8217s become increasingly easy to access vast amounts of information almost instantaneously.  As a result, it&#8217s less important for students to memorize facts than it is for them to be able to read, evaluate, and synthesize information from different sources. In my six years of teaching, I&#8217ve taught many courses, including Chemistry, Physics, AP Chem, AP Physics C (calculus-based physics), and Freshmen Research, but in every class that I&#8217ve taught, my students have learned critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and clear communication of ideas. To promote this kind of learning, I use an inquiry-based approach founded on hands-on exploratory activities, Socratic discussions, and small group engagement with challenging problems.</p>
    <h2>Classroom Examples</h2>
    <h3>Discussion Qs and Student Work</h3>
    <p>Here's an example of the type of problems that I ask my students to discuss:</p>

    <p>And here's an example from chemistry:</p>

    <p>This led to a border war (boarder war?) instigated by Group 4 in an attempt to simulate US foreign policy.</p>

    <p>I also use positive feedback to motivate my students:</p>

    <h2>Teaching Resources</h2>
    <h3>General Resources</h3>
    <p>Below is a list of books, articles, and other resources that have shaped my teaching philosophy.</p>
    <u1>
        <li><i>Teach Like a Champion</i> by Doug Lemov: I was trained as a teacher through the NYC Teaching Fellows Program, which at the time was heavily based on this book. I certainly don't agree with everything in the book, especially the overemphasis on the Workshop (I/We/You) Model of teaching, which I've found discourages critical thinking. However, most of the book really resonates with me, particularly the ideas that students rise to the occasion when held to high standards, that teachers should develop a classroom presence that is simultaneously warm and strict, and that time is <b>the</b> most precious resource in the classroom.</li>
        <li><i>Content-Area Writing</i> by Daniels, Zemelman, and Steineke: This is my favorite book from the only class that I found useful in my Masters program. It's full of great, practical strategies to incorporate writing into non-English classes. Many teachers find the idea that "every teacher is a literacy teacher" to be onerous and obnoxious, but I genuinely feel that reading and writing are some of the most efficient and effective ways of sharing information with students, and teachers should be incorporating literacy into their classrooms, not because it's the trending topic of the day is in education, but because it <b>works</b>.</li>
        <li><i>Letters to a Young Teacher</i>, <i>Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools</i>, and <i>The Shame of the Nation: the Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America</i> by Jonathan Kozol: In between a damning report on inequalities in American schools, Kozol writes moving, poignant accounts of the children he's worked with. He also offers a very different type of advice to young teachers: test scores and state standards are only a small fraction of a true education, and though you will at times feel like a tiny cog in a machine that you know is unjust, your work is important and can touch lives.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">"A Mathematician's Lament"</a> by Paul Lockhart: <q>The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, <q>math class is stupid and boring,</q> and they are right.</q> In this essay, Lockhard presents a damning critique of K-12 mathematics education, arguing that our educational system has glossed over the creativity and artistry involved in mathematics in favor of arbitrary notations and pointless definitions. While Lockhard feels that his subject alone has been uniquely bastardized by K-12 education, I argue that the majority of his criticisms apply to schooling in general: in an attempt to prepare students for standardized testing, there is a massive overemphasis on rote memorization, vocabulary words, and cutesy rules rather than actual understanding of the subject matter. I ran headlong into this problem during my first year teaching, when an entire class of AP Chemistry students could tell me that ionic compounds are structured in a crystal lattice, yet when asked to draw the structure, all but two students drew a set of disconnected pairs of atoms (basically the exact opposite of a crystal lattice). Of course it's nice for students to learn proper academic vocabulary so that they can communicate concisely with other scientists, but not at the cost of understanding what on earth they&#8217re actually talking about! On a positive note, there&#8217s been a recent push in education towards more rigorous standards that promote a deeper understanding of key topics rather than "mile high, inch deep" coverage. This trend is evidenced in the Common Core and NGSS, and the College Board has done a nice job revising their AP Physics 1 curriculum, so if we can ever figure out how to actually implement the new standards, we'll have answered many of Lockhart&#8217s criticisms.</li>
        <li><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/new">PHET Simulations</a>: A great source of programs to demonstrate hard-to-visualize concepts for students</li>
    </u1>
    <h3>Chemistry Resources</h3>
    <u1>
        <li><a href="http://www.evanschemistrycorner.com/">Evans Chemistry Corner</a>: A great source of worksheets (and labs and lesson plans) for high school chemistry</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.chemmybear.com/">Chemmybear</a>: Another great Chem resource; he&#8217s especially good for AP Chem (check out the <q>Handouts by Chapter</q> link for handouts covering the entire AP curriculum)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chemistry-Grades-9-12-100/dp/1568221878">Joan DiStasio's Chemistry workbook</a>: A nice set of worksheets. Note that some of these sheets are a bit beyond the Regents level.</li>
    </u1>
    <h3>Physics Resources</h3>
    <u1>
        <li><a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/">The Physics Classroom</a>: A nice set of physics tutorials</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.nsta.org/store/product_detail.aspx?id=10.2505/9781935155188">Uncovering Student Ideas in Physical Science</a>: This is a great book series from the National Science Teachers Association which contains worksheets designed to assesss common student misconceptions. While some of these sheets are better suited to elementary or middle school students, a suprising number are highly relevant for high school physics students. Also check out <a href="http://www.nsta.org/store/product_detail.aspx?id=10.2505/9781936137374">Volume 2</a>!</li>
