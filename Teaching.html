    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
    <p>With the advent of Google, Wikipedia, and the internet, it&#8217s become increasingly easy to access vast amounts of information almost instantaneously.  As a result, it&#8217s less important for students to memorize facts than it is for them to be able to read, evaluate, and synthesize information from different sources. In my six years of teaching, I&#8217ve taught many courses, including Chemistry, Physics, AP Chem, AP Physics C (calculus-based physics), and Freshmen Research, but in every class that I&#8217ve taught, my students have learned critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and clear communication of ideas. To promote this kind of learning, I use an inquiry-based approach founded on hands-on exploratory activities, Socratic discussions, and small group engagement with challenging problems.</p>
    <h2>Classroom Examples</h2>
    <h3>Discussion Qs and Student Work</h3>
    <p>Here's an example of the type of problems that I ask my students to discuss:</p>

    <p>And here's an example from chemistry:</p>

    <p>Student-made concept maps showing their understanding of the concept of energy:</p>

    <p>This led to a border war (boarder war?) instigated by Group 4 in an attempt to illustrate US foreign policy.</p>

    <p>I also use positive feedback to motivate my students:</p>
